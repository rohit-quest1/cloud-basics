## Version-0: Build a Simple Web Application

**Objective:**  
Develop a basic RESTful web application with the following functionalities:

### Users:
- Create user
- Update user
- Delete user
- Get user details

### Products:
- Create product
- Update product
- Delete product
- Get product details

### Orders:
- Create order
- Update order
- Get order details

**Instructions:**  
- Use **basic authentication** (e.g., JWT or simple API key or simple username/password) to secure the endpoints, ensuring only authenticated users can interact with the app.
- For the local datastore, use **MySQL** or **PostgreSQL** to persist the data. You may choose whichever you're most comfortable with. If needed, provide an example schema for Users, Products, and Orders.
- Feel free to add any additional features (pagination, error handling) based on your knowledge.

**Bonus (Optional):**
- Implement basic **input validation** for each endpoint (e.g., required fields for creating users/products/orders, valid data types, etc.).
