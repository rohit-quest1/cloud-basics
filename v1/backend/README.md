## Version-1: Deploy to AWS

**Objective:**  
Deploy the application to **AWS** using appropriate cloud services. Ensure the application is fully functional and accessible.

**Instructions:**  
- Deploy the backend using **AWS EC2** or **AWS Lambda** (use the service you are more comfortable with).
  - For EC2, use a simple web server (e.g., Node.js, Python Flask) to host the application.
  - For Lambda, use an API Gateway to expose the Lambda functions.
- Use **AWS RDS** (either MySQL or PostgreSQL) as your datastore. Ensure the application is connected to the RDS instance, and data can be retrieved and stored correctly.
- **Security:** Set up basic security for your deployed application using **AWS IAM** roles and **Security Groups** to limit access to only authorized users.
