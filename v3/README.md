## Version-3: Build and Host a Simple UI

**Objective:**  
Create a simple front-end web interface to interact with your backend, allowing users to create, update, and view users, products, and orders.

**Instructions:**  
- Build a simple UI using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or a front-end framework like React or Vue.js or Angular if you are familiar).
- The front-end should be able to perform all **CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for users, products, and orders, interacting with the backend you deployed in Version-1.
- Host the UI as a static website on **AWS S3**.
- The UI should consume the backend APIs to fetch, create, update, and delete data (via RESTful calls).

**My Approach:**  
- I built the frontend application using React with Tremor Components for styling and   


**Bonus (Optional):**
- Add **client-side validation** for form inputs (e.g., check if a field is empty before submission).

## General Bonus Ideas (Optional for all versions):

1. **Logging and Monitoring:** Set up **AWS CloudWatch** to monitor the appâ€™s logs and performance metrics (e.g., for EC2 or Lambda). This will teach you how to monitor and debug your cloud applications.
2. **Error Handling:** Implement proper error handling across the application, ensuring that meaningful error messages are returned to the client when something goes wrong.

## Final Notes:
- **Documentation:** Encourage you to document your work well. This includes creating API documentation for the backend (Using tools like Postman or Swagger for API documentation).
- **Security Best Practices:** Reminder to consider **security best practices** such as proper permissions, securing the S3 bucket access etc.,
